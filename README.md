# Standard Chartered Robot Vacuum exercise

The application is a simulation of a robot vacuum moving in an area of dimensions 5 units by 5 units.
There are no other obstructions in the area.
The robot is free to roam around the area but must be prevented from leaving the area.
Any movement that would result in the robot leaving the area must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still be allowed.
