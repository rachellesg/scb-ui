# Standard Chartered Robot Vacuum exercise

The application is a simulation of a robot vacuum moving in an area of dimensions 5 units by 5 units.
There are no other obstructions in the area.
The robot is free to roam around the area but must be prevented from leaving the area.
Any movement that would result in the robot leaving the area must be prevented, however further valid movement commands must still be allowed.

### Instructions:

1.Write clean and readible code // MOST IMPORTANT
2.Must cover with unit tests & use React library
3.Extra points for UX design and/or using React Material UI
4.Extra points for using Typescript.
5.Include instructions on how to run the application in Readme.md file
6.Send a link to the source code on GitHub and if possible deploy the solution using Github Pages (https://pages.github.com/)
7.Provide the ability to test the application.
